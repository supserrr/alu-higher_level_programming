# Python - Inheritance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain to anyone, without needing to look anything up:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What a superclass, base class, or parent class is
- What a subclass is
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another class
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What the default class that every class inherits from is
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from a base class
- Which attributes or methods are inherited and available to subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance
- What `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions are, and when and how to use them
